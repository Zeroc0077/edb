//! Centralized state management system for TUI
//!
//! This module implements a unified manager architecture with the following components:
//!
//! - `DataManager`: Central container holding all managers, passed to all app functions
//! - `ExecutionManager`: Manages trace and snapshot data with cached state
//! - `Resolver`: Handles ABI resolution and address labeling with cached lookups
//! - `Theme`: Direct theme configuration without async wrapping
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The manager system follows a two-layer design:
//!
//! 1. **Manager Layer** (e.g., ExecutionManager, Resolver)
//!    - Holds cached state for immediate read access
//!    - Tracks pending requests when data is not cached
//!    - User-controllable state (e.g., current_snapshot) lives here
//!
//! 2. **Core Layer** (e.g., ExecutionManagerCore, ResolverCore)
//!    - Wrapped in Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock>
//!    - Handles RPC communication and data fetching
//!    - Processes pending requests from managers
//!    - Run by background tasks spawned in TUI::run()
//!
//! # Data Flow
//!
//! 1. Panels read from managers during render (non-blocking)
//! 2. Cache misses create pending requests
//! 3. App::update() pushes pending requests to cores
//! 4. Background tasks process core pending requests
//! 5. App::update() pulls processed data back to managers
//!
//! # Benefits
//!
//! - **Non-blocking UI**: Rendering never waits on RPC calls
//! - **Centralized state**: Single DataManager instance for all panels
//! - **Efficient caching**: Data fetched once, used everywhere
//! - **Clean separation**: UI logic separate from data fetching
